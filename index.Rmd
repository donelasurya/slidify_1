## Introduction

This Shiny Application is used to find the Compound interest and finally the total amount accumulated for a given principal, interest rate, no of times compounded per year and the time in years

--- .class #id 

## Inputs to the Application

User needs to enter the following Inputs :

1) Principal, P

2) Rate of Interest, r

3) No of time compounded per year, n

4) Time period in years, t

--- .class #id 

## Formulation 

Following is the textbook formulation for Compound interest and Amount accumulated 

Compound Interest = P * (1 + r/ n )^(r*t) - P

Amount Accumulated = P * (1 + r/ n )^(r*t)

--- .class #id 

## Example 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
P = 100000
r = 0.5
n = 2
t = 1
Compound_interest = P * (1 + r/ n )^(r*t) - P
Amount_accumulated = P * (1 + r/ n )^(r*t)
print(paste("Compound Interest is ",as.integer(Compound_interest),sep = "Rs."))
print(paste("Amount accumulated is  ",as.integer(Amount_accumulated),sep = "Rs."))
```
